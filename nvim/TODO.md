# TODO list with ideas

1. Replace nerdtree with [defx](https://github.com/Shougo/defx.nvim).
2. Replace my home baked autocomplete stuff with [deoplete](https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim).
3. Change status line background color [as described here](https://shapeshed.com/vim-statuslines/).
4. Change tabline so that it displays a "main" file name.
