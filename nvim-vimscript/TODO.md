# TODO list with ideas

1. Replace my home baked autocomplete stuff with [deoplete](https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim).
2. Change status line background color [as described here](https://shapeshed.com/vim-statuslines/). Also see [this](https://github.com/adjco/vim-tabline/blob/master/plugin/vim-tabline.vim).
3. Change tabline so that it displays a "main" file name.
